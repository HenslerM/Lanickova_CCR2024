# Abstract

Patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) are virtually insensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) employed as standalone therapeutics, at least in part reflecting microenvironmental immunosuppression. Thus, conventional chemotherapeutics and targeted anticancer agents that not only mediate cytotoxic effects but also promote the recruitment of immune effector cells to the HGSOC microenvironment stand out as promising combinatorial partners for ICIs in this oncological indication. As ICI sensitivity is largely dictated by the immune contexture of primary and metastatic disease sites, we explored the clinical relevance of neo-adjuvant paclitaxel-carboplatin chemotherapy on the immunological configuration of paired primary and metastatic HGSOC. We found neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)-driven endoplasmic reticulum stress and calreticulin (CALR) exposure in metastatic HGSOC lesions culminates with the establishment of a dense immune infiltrate including follicular T cells (TFH cells), a prerequisite for mature tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation. In this context, TLS maturation was associated with an increased intratumoral density of ICI-sensitive TCF1+PD1+ CD8+ T cells over their ICI-insensitive TIM3+PD1+ counterparts. Consistent with this notion, chemotherapy coupled with a PD1-targeting ICI provided a significant survival benefit over either therapeutic approach in syngeneic models of HGSOC bearing high (but not low) tumor mutational burden. Altogether, our findings suggest that NACT promotes TLS formation and maturation in HGSOC lesions, de facto preserving an intratumoral ICI-sensitive T-cell phenotype. These observations emphasize the role of rational design, especially relative to administration schedule, for clinical trials testing chemotherapy plus ICIs in patients with HGSOC.
